# GalMerge
The aim of this project it to simulate of the dynamics of Galactic mergers using the Barnes-Hut algorithm implemented in Python.

To do this simulation we will randomly generate two clouds of particles and let them interact. These two clouds should be realistic representations of Galaxies. To enforce this, we will randomly sample using density functions representative of real world density profiles.
In addition, we also hope to sample spiral galaxies for our dynamical simulation.

With our simulations we hope to find answers to the following questions...
