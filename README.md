# GalMerge
The aim of this project it to simulate of the dynamics of Galactic mergers using the Barnes-Hut (BH) algorithm implemented in Python 3.x in a fast and scalable way using multiprocessing and JIT (Just In Time) compilation.

To make a simulation change and edit `main.py`. This code accepts command line arguments which are explained on the help page shown by running `python3 main.py --help`. Running `main.py` will generate four files:
- `Properties.npz`: Contains the run parameters, number of cells generated and number of particles considered by Barnes-Hut.
- `Data.npz`: Contains the locations, velocity and forces acting on each particle for each frame of the simulation.
- `Cells.npz`: Contains the cell objects generated by Barnes-Hut for each frame of the simulation.
- `animations/animation.mp4`: An animation of the simulation.

`Animator.py` provides more possibilities for making simulations such as making an animation of the **cells**, toggling the grid on and off, coloring particles according to the magnitude of the gravitational force acting on it or its velocity etc.
